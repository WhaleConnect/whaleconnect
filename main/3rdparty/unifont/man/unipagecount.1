.TH UNIPAGECOUNT 1 "2007 Dec 31"
.SH NAME
unipagecount \- Count the assigned code points in a GNU Unifont .hex file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunipagecount \fP[\-P\fIplane\fP] [\-p\fIpagenum\fP] [\-h|\-l]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unipagecount
reads a GNU Unifont .hex file from STDIN and prints a 16 by 16 grid of the
number of defined code points in each 256 character block within a Unicode
plane to STDOUT.  Code points proceed from left to right, then top to bottom.
In all planes, code points U+*FFFE and U+*FFFF are not expected in the input
hex file; they are reserved and always counted as being present in a plane.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
.BR \-P
Select a Unicode plane, from 0 through 16, inclusive.  If not specified,
.B unipagecount
defaults to Plane 0 (the Basic Multilingual Plane).
.TP
.BR \-p
Just print information on one 256 code point "page" rather than
the entire Basic Multilingual Plane.  This prints a 16 by 16 table with
an asterisk in every code point that has an assigned glyph.
.TP
.BR \-h
Print an HTML table with color-coded cell background colors
instead of a plain text table.
.TP
.BR \-l
[The letter "l"]: Print hyperlinks to font bitmaps in the HTML table.
To create the bitmaps themselves, use the
.B unihex2bmp
program.  The bitmaps are assumed to be in the directory "bmp/".
