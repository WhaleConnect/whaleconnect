.SH NAME
unigencircles \- Add dashed combining circles to a unifont.hex file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunigencircles \fIcombining.txt nonprinting.hex \fR< \fIunifont.hex \fP> \fIunifont-circles.hex\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unigencircles
reads a unifont.hex file from STDIN, adds dashed combining
circles to the hex strings for code points listed in "combining.txt"
but not listed in "nonprinting.hex", and writes the revised set of glyphs
in unifont.hex format to STDOUT.  The resulting combining character glyphs
show the dashed combining circles that appear in The Unicode Standard
code charts.
.PP
For each code point listed in the "combining.txt" file but not listed
in the "nonprinting.hex" file,
.B unigencircles
will superimpose a single-width dashed circle in glyphs that are
single-width (i.e., their hex glyph strings are 32 characters long)
and will superimpose a double-width dashed circle in glyphs that
are double-width (i.e., their hex glyph strings are 64 characters long).
