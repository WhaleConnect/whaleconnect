.TH UNIBMPBUMP 1 "2019 Mar 2"
.SH NAME
unibmpbump \- adjust a .bmp image for unibmp2hex processing
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunibmpbump \fP[\-i\fIinput-file.bmp\fP] [\-o\fIoutput-file.bmp\fP] [\-v|\-\-verbose] [\-V|\-\-version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unibmpbump
reads a Microsoft Bitmap Graphics (".bmp") graphics image file and,
if it appears to be in a known format, converts it for processing
by \fBunibmp2hex\fP(1).
.PP
.B unibmpbump
supports the following Device Independent Bitmap (DIB) header
byte lengths for input image files:
.RS
.TP 6
12
The BITMAPCOREHEADER format.  This was the original Microsoft
Windows header format.  It has not been encoutered, and was
added only as a subset of the formats that appear below.
.TP
40
The BITMAPINFOHEADER format.  This is the format that most
graphics creation programs support, and is the header format
that \fBunibmp2hex\fP expects.
.TP
108
The BITMAPV4HEADER format.  This is the format that the
Image Magick \fBconvert\fP program creates when converting
a PNG image to a BMP image using the "\-monochrome" option.
.TP
124
The BITMAPV5HEADER format.  This is the format that the
Image Magick \fBconvert\fP program creates when converting
a PNG image to a BMP image without the "\-monochrome" option;
\fBconvert\fP will encode the image as a "grayscale" image,
but with only two colors: black and white.
.RE
.PP
.B unibmpbump
is able to read files created by \fBunihex2png\fP that were subsequently
saved as BMP files, for example by the \fBconvert\fP(1) program,
which is part of the Image Magick package.  Images created by
\fBunihex2png\fP(1) are 544 rows high by 560 columns wide.
Images created by \fBunihex2bmp\fP(1) are 544 rows high by 576
columns wide.  Thus, if the input Bitmap Graphics file is
544 by 560 pixels, \fBunibmpbump\fP assumes that the file was
originally a Portable Network Graphics (".png") file created
by \fBunihex2png\fP and realigns the glyphs so they are
positioned as \fBunibmp2hex\fP expects.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 6
.BR \-i
Specify an input Bitmaps Graphics (".bmp") file.
If no input file is specified, input is taken from stdin.
The input file must be either 544 rows by 560 columns (for a
file created by \fBunihex2png\fP originally) or
544 rows by 576 columns (for a file created by \fBunihex2bmp\fP
originally).
.TP
.BR \-o
Specify an output Bitmaps Graphics (".bmp") file.
If no output file is specified, output is sent to stdout.
The output file will be 544 rows high by 576 columns wide
with a 40 byte Device Independent Bitmap (DIB) header,
which is the format that \fBunibmp2hex\fP expects.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Verbose output.  Print information about the input file on stderr.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print the version of \fBunibmpbump\fP and exit.
.SH FILES
Bitmap Graphics (".bmp") input and output files.
