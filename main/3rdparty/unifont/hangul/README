This hangul/ directory contains the files from which to build the
Unifont source file hangul-syllables.hex.

Precompiled versions of the input files hangul-base.hex and hangul-base.bdf,
and the final output file hangul-syllables.hex, are in the precompiled/
subdirectory.

The hangul-syllables.hex file is the same file that appears in the
"font/plane00" directory.

To build hangul-syllables.hex from the input files, simply type

     make

in this directory.  Note that the Unifont binary programs must be installed
in your binary path (e.g., /usr/local/bin).  This make file performs the
following actions:

   - Creates the file hangul-base.hex, initialized with a blank
     code point 0x0000 (a double-width row of zeroes)

   - Appends the files contained in hanbase-00.bmp, hanbase-01.bmp,
     and hanbase-02.bmp, converting them into .hex format with unibmp2hex

   - Converts the resulting hangul-base.hex file into hangul-base.bdf
     (the glyphs in BDF font format) using hex2bdf -- this is a special
     Johab BDF base font suitable for Korean software that uses Johab fonts

   - Use johab2ucs2 to convert this BDF font file into hangul-syllables.hex

   - Output bitmapped renderings of the Unicode Hangul Syllables block,
     placing .bmp files in the syllables/ subdirectory

   - Create ksx-syllables.hex by feeding unifont-base.hex to unifontksx

   - Output bitmapped renderings of the KS X 1001:1992 subset of 2,350
     syllables, placing .bmp files in the ksx-syllables/ subdirectory

   - Create chojung-syllables.hex by feeding unifont-base.hex to unifontchojung

   - Output bitmapped renderings of the subset of syllables that do not
     have final consonants, placing .bmp files in the chojung-syllables/
     subdirectory

To remove files created during a build, type

     make clean

or

     make distclean
